A simple test to track down some platform-specific differences we were
seeing in freetype font rendering inside of matplotlib.

Thanks to Thomas Robitaille (@astrofrog) for setting a lot of the
theoretical groundwork for this.

BUILD:
        make

RUN:
        ./freetype_test [charcode] [fontfile] [ptsize] [dpi] [stretch] [output_file]

        e.g.:

        ./freetype_test Vera.ttf 97 20 500 8 test

        To match what matplotlib does, set stretch to 8.  To turn off
        the effect of stretching (to see if it matters) set stretch to
        1.

        This will output two files, test_grey.pgm (greyscale antialiased)
        and test_mono.pgm (monochrome bitmap).
