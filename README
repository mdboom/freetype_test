A simple test to track down some platform-specific differences we were
seeing in freetype font rendering inside of matplotlib.

Thanks to Thomas Robitaille (@astrofrog) for setting a lot of the
theoretical groundwork for this.

BUILD:
        make

RUN:
        ./freetype_test [charcode] [fontfile] [ptsize] [dpi] [stretch] [output_file]

        e.g.:

        ./freetype_test Vera.ttf 97 20 500 8 test.pgm

        To match what matplotlib does, set stretch to 8.  To turn off
        the effect of stretching (to see if it matters) set stretch to
        1.

        The output file is a PGM format file, which can be converted
        to other formats using ImageMagick.
