A simple test to track down some platform-specific differences we were
seeing in freetype font rendering inside of matplotlib.

Thanks to Thomas Robitaille (@astrofrog) for setting a lot of the
theoretical groundwork for this.

BUILD:
        make

RUN:
        ./freetype_test [fontfile] [ptsize] [dpi]

        e.g.:

        ./freetype_test Vera.ttf 12 300
